        <blockquote>
            “Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'”
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Freedom, Gender Roles, and the Paradox of Control</h3>
        <p>
            The quote from <em>Born a Crime</em> shows a conflict many people face about gender and relationships. Abel wants a traditional wife but does not like women who are quiet and obedient. This shows a problem: he admires free women but wants to control them at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, many men say they like strong, independent women, but they also want to be in charge in their relationships. The idea of putting a woman "in a cage" means some men want to keep control over their partner’s freedom instead of supporting it.
        </p>
        <p>
            This problem happens in many cultures and is often supported by traditions and media. For example, women who are leaders or creative may be respected in public but face problems at home if their independence challenges old ideas about men being the boss.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have seen friends struggle with this. Some men are attracted to confident women but later feel scared or jealous of their strength. This can lead to trying to limit their freedom, like putting them in a cage.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, things are changing. Many young people want equal relationships where both partners respect each other and have freedom. The challenge is to forget old ideas about men controlling women and to build relationships where both can grow.
        </p>
        <p>
            This quote makes us think: do we really want our partners to be free, or do we want to control them? How we answer this affects our relationships and the fight for gender equality.
