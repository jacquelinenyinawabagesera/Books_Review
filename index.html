        <h2>Suggested New Title</h2>
        <p><strong>New Title:</strong> <em>Illegally Alive: Stories from a Divided Childhood</em></p>
        <h3>Why This Title?</h3>
        <p>
            The original title, <em>Born a Crime</em>, captures Trevor Noah's existence as a mixed-race child under apartheid, where his very birth was illegal. The proposed title, <em>Illegally Alive: Stories from a Divided Childhood</em>, highlights both the legal paradox of his existence and the fractured world he navigated. It emphasizes resilience and survival against systemic injustice.

        <h2>Reflective Blog</h2>
        <blockquote>
            “Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'”
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Freedom, Gender Roles, and the Paradox of Control</h3>
        <p>
            This quote from <em>Born a Crime</em> resonates deeply with ongoing conversations about gender roles and relationship expectations. Abel’s desire for a "traditional" wife, contrasted with his attraction to independent women, reveals a fundamental contradiction that persists in many societies today: the simultaneous admiration and suppression of female autonomy.
        </p>
        <p>
            In modern contexts, many men express admiration for strong, independent women, yet struggle to reconcile this with ingrained expectations of dominance or control within relationships. The metaphor of the "cage" is particularly striking-it suggests that some people, consciously or not, are drawn to partners whose freedom and spirit they wish to possess, rather than nurture.
        </p>
        <p>
            This dynamic is visible in various cultures and is often perpetuated by media and tradition. For example, successful women in leadership or creative roles are frequently celebrated publicly, but may encounter resistance or resentment in their personal relationships, especially if their independence challenges traditional gender hierarchies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personally, I have witnessed friends-both men and women-navigate this tension. Some men, raised with conventional ideas about masculinity, find themselves attracted to confident, outspoken partners, only to later feel threatened by the very qualities that drew them in. This often leads to attempts, subtle or overt, to limit their partner’s independence, echoing the "cage" metaphor.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, there is a growing shift. Many young people now actively seek egalitarian relationships, where mutual respect and freedom are foundational. The challenge is unlearning deep-seated notions about gender and control, and instead embracing partnerships where both individuals are free to thrive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, this quote challenges us to reflect on our own expectations: Do we truly value our partners’ freedom, or are we unconsciously seeking to confine it? The answer shapes not only our relationships, but the broader progress toward gender equality.
